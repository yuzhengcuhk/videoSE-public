**[MMSys22] Encrypted Video Search: Scalable, Modular, and Content-similar**
 
We initiate the study of scalable encrypted video search in which a client can search videos similar to an image query. Our modular framework abstracts intrinsic attributes of videos in semantics and visuals to capture their contents. We advocate two-step searches by incorporating lightweight searchable encryption techniques for pre-screening and an interactive approach for fine-grained search.

The details of this project are presented in the following paper:

In 13th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference (MMSys'22)

## Setup
We tested our code by running with,
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz√ó4, 32GiB RAM
- GPU specialized by GeForce RTX 1080 Ti
- Deepin

## Usage and Reference
For SE: [opensse-schemes](https://github.com/OpenSSE/opensse-schemes), compiled in `opensse-schemes/build`.

For generating hashing code of videos: we use [deephash](https://github.com/yuanli2333/Hadamard-Matrix-for-hashing).

For index: see `index.json` in `opensse-schemes/build/src`. use `-l` to import `index.json` to SSE database.

For showing results: see `check pic`, which indexes to corresponding videos.

## Disclaimer
PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS CODE TO ANY REAL-WORLD DATA OR COMPUTATION!

This code is just a proof-of-concept meant for performance testing of our framework ONLY. It is full of security vulnerabilities that facilitate testing, debugging, and performance measurements. In any real-world deployment, these vulnerabilities can be easily exploited to leak all user inputs.

This work started when the authors are very junior ... Back to Dec, 2017 ...
